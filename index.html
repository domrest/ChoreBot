## About The Project

The inspiration of the project was taken from the waste management necessity for our planet. To target a zero waste planet, healthy habits with useful gadgets can help us move towards this global goal. 

The most common issue we see is that in the public spaces and streets the trash bins are collected and emptied without even checking if they are full or not which leads to waste of resources. And sometimes, the trash bins would start overflowing and waste would collect and would continue to pile up ruining the natural and preserved spaces. To target this issue we started at a smaller level.

We planned on implementing this idea at home by implementing a smart bin - a 'TrashBot' which upon measuring the temperature of the waste would detect the decay and send an alert to user to empty the trash. Along with creating a fun home automation project this will help create a healthy habit of being mindful of clearing the waste timely.

This project can then be expanded for largescale implementation especially in residential area streets and parks. Before trash overflows and starts to decay spreading unpleasant smell in beautiful natural spaces, Trashbot will send an alert to the waste collectors.

            ## Getting Started

There are 3 components to this project - `Email Alert`, `Gui`, and `Temperature Sensors`.

### `Temperature Sensors` 
More documentation about `Temperature Sensors` can be found [here](./docs/TemperatureSensors.md)
### `Email Alert `
More documentation about `Email Alert ` can be found [here](./docs/Messaging.md)
### `Gui`
More documentation about `Gui` can be found [here](./docs/GUI.md)

To get the project up and running by yourself, follow these steps:
### Prerequisites

GUI Prerequisites:

`apt-get install qtdeclarative5-dev-tools`

`apt-get install libqcustomplot-dev`

Email Messaging Prerequisites:

`sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`

`sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`

Temp Sensor Prerequisites:

`sudo apt-get install pigpio python-pigpio python3-pigpio`


### Installation

Run Cmake within directory:

`cmake .`

Run Make:

`make`

Run Program:

`sudo ./Trashbot`

<h1 align="center"> Temperature Sensors </h1>

## Temperature Sensor usage
Trashbot receives its temperature readings via two Tsic 306 temperature sensors, which have an error of +-0.3 K and a sampling rate of 10 Hz. These are connected to the Pi via the ground and 5V Power, and with the data pins connected to seperate GPIO ports. The TSIC Temperature Sensors will communicate to the Pi passing the current temperature reading from the sensor through two packets of data transmitted at a Baud Rate of 8kHz This is done through the ZACWire Protocol. The Pi will interrupt on every bit received, storing the bit and decoding it into a temperature once both packets arrive.

## Temperature Sensor Component

As stated the temperature sensors utilised within the system are two TSIC 306 sensors
These can be found on <a href="https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/temperature-humidity-sensor-ics/1218022/">RS-Online</a> for a price of Â£6.46 each.

The sensor has Three pins:
- Power
- Data
- Ground

Which were soldered to distinct wires

The Power wires were then connected to the same Power pin on the Raspberry Pi, similarly to the Ground wires conencted to the same ground pin on the raspberryPi.
GPIO pins 23 and 24 were connected to the remaining Data wires.
